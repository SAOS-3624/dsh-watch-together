# Changelog

All notable changes to **dsh-watch-together** are documented here.
This package starts its own version line at `0.1.0` — it is not a continuation of `dsh-video-storyboard`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-10-30

First release as a standalone plugin. The feature existed inside `dsh-video-storyboard` 0.4.x as
`src/watch/`; it is now its own package with its own entry point, its own version, and a one-way
dependency on `dsh-video-storyboard`.

### Added

- **`watch_together`** — watch a video together with a text-only agent. Instead of one whole-film
  storyboard, it follows the user's **real playback position** and hands over one segment at a time,
  `lead` seconds before the segment ends. The next segment is built while the user is still watching
  the current one, so delivery is perceived as instant (4/4 measured deliveries at 0.0 s).
- **Ramp-up start.** Segment lengths grow `[60, 120, 180, 240]` → `segment`, so the first line lands
  around 45 s instead of after a full 5-minute batch. `ramp: []` disables the ladder.
- **Double buffering.** `depth: 2` keeps the current batch plus the next one built, and starts the
  one after that while the user watches.
- **Playback position from the OS media session (SMTC)**, no player plugin required: VLC /
  PotPlayer / Movies & TV for local files, Edge / Chrome for the web. Confined to
  `src/watch-probe.js` + `src/watch_smtc.py`.
- **Optional millisecond-accurate mode.** Point the plugin at a browser started with
  `--remote-debugging-port` and it reads `<video>.currentTime` directly, and the page URL becomes
  the source (`file:///D:/x.mp4` → local path) — no searching, no downloading, no asking.
- **Honest confidence levels.** `fresh` (refreshed within 10 s), `extrapolated` (stale but playing —
  requires crossing 15 extra seconds before speaking), `unknown` (over 45 s — never extrapolates,
  asks for `cursor` instead). A wrong cursor poisons every later segment, so it refuses to guess.
- **The speech seam, with no engine.** `src/speech-bus.js` exposes `onSpeech(handler, { voice })`,
  `emitSpeech()`, `speechEvents()` and `lastSpeech()`. The plugin ships no engine, no default
  adapter and no voice parameters; `watch_together` results carry `speech: [{ at, text, state }]`
  and the loop emits `state: 'due'` when a line is actually due.
- **Adapters loaded by path.** `~/.dsh/voice.json` `{ "adapter": "<path or module>" }` (or
  `DSH_VOICE_ADAPTER`) is `import()`ed once at startup; the module exports `attach(api)` and returns
  a detach. Nothing is bundled, and a failure only logs a warning.
- **`examples/voice-edge-tts/`** — a working adapter (edge-tts → `ffplay` → system-voice fallback).
  It prints `[voice 03:11.4] <line>` to stderr for every line that comes due; that log, not the
  audio, is what you want when checking *when* text fires.
- **One text stream for the chat box.** `chat.jsonl` carries `line` (scripted), `assistant`
  (interjection) and `user`, with `say: true` marking the speakable ones.
  `watch_together({ say: "…" })` is how the model gets its interjection in — the plugin cannot read a
  normal reply. `attachSpeechToChat()` subscribes with `voice: false`, so a display-only consumer can
  never silence the loop.
- **A localhost chat page** (`/` full view, `/widget` capsule) with an `/api/messages` long-poll and
  an `/api/say` callback. This is the only channel that actually reaches a blocked `watch_together`
  call — messages typed into the host's own input box are appended to the session log *after* the
  blocking call returns (measured: 42 s of polling, 0 bytes written).
- **`examples/floating-chat/window.py`** — a real floating window without a browser: frameless,
  always-on-top, translucent, stdlib tkinter only. Reads the same `chat.jsonl`.
- **`bin/watch.mjs`** — a CLI shell for sessions that have no `watch_together` tool. It imports the
  same `src/`, so behaviour cannot drift from the plugin.

### Fixed

- **`watch_smtc.py` was in the wrong directory.** `probePlayback()` ran `execFile(python,
  join(HERE, 'watch_smtc.py'))`, but the script sat one level up (`src/` while the caller was in
  `src/watch/`). Every SMTC probe therefore failed with a bare `Command failed:` and the plugin
  silently fell back to "position unreadable". The script now lives next to `src/watch-probe.js`,
  where the caller expects it.
- **The CLI imported pre-refactor paths** (`src/browser-time.js`, `src/pipeline.js`, …) that no
  longer exist, so `bin/watch.mjs` could not even start. All imports now resolve through the
  `dsh-video-storyboard` package name.

### Changed

- `detachAdapters()` no longer reaches into the bus's private subscriber map; it calls
  `__resetSpeech()` from `speech-bus.js`.
- `watch-run.js` imported `./watch.js` twice; merged into one import.

### Known limits

- **Speaker separation is not attempted.** Measured on the reference machine: per-sentence cam++
  embeddings split single-speaker material into 6 speakers; demucs pre-separation made no difference
  (median similarity 0.62 → 0.61); FunASR's `ClusterBackend` returns "one speaker" outright below 20
  speech segments — short clips are outside its operating range by design.
- **Interjection audio can collide with a line already being spoken.** Windows mixes both SAPI
  instances, so `say` occupies `quiet-until.json` before speaking and `cue` skips lines inside that
  window (it skips rather than defers — deferring desynchronises from the picture). The remaining
  gap is the 3–8 s while a line is mid-speech, which cannot be cut short.
- **CRLF-less assumption.** The chat page replaces `__PORT__` in the templates per start; changing
  the port while a browser tab is already open requires a reload.
